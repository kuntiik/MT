class MatchErrorRate(Metric):
    r"""
    Match error rate (MatchErrorRate_) is a common metric of the performance of an automatic speech recognition system.
    This value indicates the percentage of words that were incorrectly predicted and inserted.
    The lower the value, the better the performance of the ASR system with a MatchErrorRate of 0 being a perfect score.
    Match error rate can then be computed as:

    .. math::
        mer = \frac{S + D + I}{N + I} = \frac{S + D + I}{S + D + C + I}

    where:
        - S is the number of substitutions,
        - D is the number of deletions,
        - I is the number of insertions,
        - C is the number of correct words,
        - N is the number of words in the reference (N=S+D+C).


    Args:
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and returns None if this is set to False.

            .. deprecated:: v0.8
                Argument has no use anymore and will be removed v0.9.

        kwargs:
            Additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

    Returns:
        Match error rate score

    Examples:
        >>> preds = ["this is the prediction", "there is an other sample"]
        >>> target = ["this is the reference", "there is another one"]
        >>> metric = MatchErrorRate()
        >>> metric(preds, target)
